# CFBRanker
A college football team ranking system coded in Java.

# Fixes
- Change the teamMaster to only be 128 in size which might fix my matrix issue

# Notice
At the moment most of the ranking algorithm is almost identical to the Colley Matrix Method and all rights belong to
the creator of that method.  As my abilities improve I would like to have my own version of a system but keep the
Colley Method for comparison as well as other computer ranking systems if they are publically known.

# Issues
- Matrix is not symetrical!
- No GUI
- No validity check coded yet

# Version
0.1
 - Initial release
 - Not usable but works when matrix issue is fixed
